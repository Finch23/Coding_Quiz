# Coding_Quiz
For this application, we were tasked with creating a coding game that would begin with a start button.
When the start button is clicked, the quiz begins and runs through the array of questions.
I chose to dynamically add buttons for each choice in a for loop depending on which question was being shown.
Once you have answered all of the questions, the application will keep track of your score and you will sign your highschore with your initials.
